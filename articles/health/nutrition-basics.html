    <h1>Women’s Health Basics: Train, Fuel, and Recover by Your Physiology</h1>
    <p>Women aren’t just smaller men—our hormones, metabolism, fluid balance, and recovery needs shift across the menstrual cycle. When you align training, nutrition, sleep, and stress with your physiology, you unlock better performance, leaner composition, and steadier energy. This guide distills foundational principles inspired by <strong>Dr. Stacy Sims</strong> to help you build a strong, cycle-aware routine.</p>

    <h2>Your Cycle at a Glance</h2>
    <p>The menstrual cycle typically has four phases. Symptoms and performance can vary person to person—use these patterns as starting points and adjust based on your data.</p>

    <h3>Follicular Phase (CD 1–13)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physiology:</strong> Estrogen rises; inflammation often lower after early bleeding days.</li>
      <li><strong>Training focus:</strong> Strength and skill work respond well; add progressive overload and technique.</li>
      <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> Emphasize carbohydrates around training for power and adaptation; prioritize protein at each meal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ovulatory Window (CD 14–17)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physiology:</strong> Peak estrogen; often feel powerful and explosive.</li>
      <li><strong>Training focus:</strong> Sprints, plyometrics, heavy lifts if you feel great; mind joint laxity and warm up thoroughly.</li>
      <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> Carb prime pre-workout; protein + carbs post-session for recovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Early–Mid Luteal (CD 18–24)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physiology:</strong> Progesterone rises—core temperature increases, respiration rate may rise, and you may feel hotter during sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Training focus:</strong> Sustain strength with moderate loads; include intervals but manage heat stress.</li>
      <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> Slightly higher energy needs; increase electrolytes and hydration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Late Luteal / Premenstrual (CD 25–28)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physiology:</strong> Estrogen and progesterone drop—potential for bloating, lower mood, and sleep disruption.</li>
      <li><strong>Training focus:</strong> Deload: technique, mobility, core, and low-impact conditioning.</li>
      <li><strong>Fueling:</strong> Focus on protein, magnesium-rich foods, complex carbs, and sodium/electrolytes to offset fluid shifts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Macronutrients for Women: What to Prioritize</h2>

    <h3>Protein: The Adaptation Anchor</h3>
    <p>Protein drives muscle repair, lean mass, and appetite control.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily target:</strong> ~1.6–2.2 g/kg body weight (higher end when training hard or in a deficit).</li>
      <li><strong>Per meal:</strong> 25–40 g with 2–3 g leucine (e.g., dairy, whey, eggs, fish) to trigger muscle protein synthesis.</li>
      <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Distribute across 3–4 meals; include protein pre- and post-training.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Carbohydrates: Performance and Hormone Support</h3>
    <p>Carbs fuel intensity, support thyroid and reproductive health, and protect against low energy availability.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before training:</strong> 20–40 g easily digested carbs (~30–90 min prior).</li>
      <li><strong>During (if >60 min hard):</strong> 30–60 g/hour from sports drink, chews, or gels.</li>
      <li><strong>After:</strong> 1–1.2 g/kg within ~2 hours + 25–40 g protein.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Fats: Hormones and Satiety</h3>
    <p>Healthy fats aid hormone production and absorption of vitamins A, D, E, K.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado, fatty fish.</li>
      <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep pre-workout fat lower for faster gastric emptying; include fats at other meals for satiety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Micronutrients Women Should Watch</h2>

    <h3>Iron</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Supports oxygen transport; losses can increase with menstruation.</li>
      <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Lean meats, fish, eggs, legumes, leafy greens; pair plant iron with vitamin C.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Calcium &amp; Vitamin D</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Bone density, neuromuscular function, immunity.</li>
      <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Dairy, fortified plant milks, small fish with bones, sunlight (D), and fatty fish.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Magnesium &amp; Zinc</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Why:</strong> Sleep, recovery, PMS symptom support (magnesium); immunity and tissue repair (zinc).</li>
      <li><strong>Sources:</strong> Nuts, seeds, cocoa (magnesium); seafood, pumpkin seeds, legumes (zinc).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hydration &amp; Electrolytes: Not Just Water</h2>
    <p>In the luteal phase, higher core temperature and sodium losses can increase perceived exertion. Hydration strategy matters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Daily baseline:</strong> Aim for pale-yellow urine.</li>
      <li><strong>Before training:</strong> 300–500 ml fluid with electrolytes (sodium is key).</li>
      <li><strong>During heat/high intensity (&gt;45–60 min):</strong> 150–250 ml every 15–20 min + electrolytes.</li>
      <li><strong>After:</strong> Replace ~150% of fluid lost (use bodyweight change as a guide) with sodium-containing fluids.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Training by Phase: Practical Playbook</h2>
    <h3>Menstrual (Days 1–4)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Low impact strength, mobility, breathwork; train if you feel up to it.</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Iron-rich foods, warm fluids, protein + complex carbs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Follicular (Days 5–13)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Push strength (3–5 sets, 3–8 reps for big lifts) + technique; add short HIIT.</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Carb-centered around training; hit protein targets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ovulation (Days 14–17)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Power sessions (sprints, jumps) if joints feel stable; thorough warm-up and landing mechanics.</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Pre-session carbs; post session protein + carbs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Luteal (Days 18–28)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Maintain strength with moderate loads; steady intervals; manage heat.</li>
      <li><strong>Fuel:</strong> Slightly higher calories; elevate electrolytes and hydration; prioritize sleep hygiene.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Low Energy Availability &amp; RED-S: Know the Signs</h2>
    <p>Under-fueling relative to training can disrupt cycles, slow recovery, and increase injury risk.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing or irregular periods (if not on hormonal contraception)</li>
      <li>Persistent fatigue, plateauing performance, frequent illness</li>
      <li>Hair loss, brittle nails, low mood, sleep disruption</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>If these resonate, increase energy intake—especially carbs—and consult a qualified clinician or sports dietitian.</em></p>

    <h2>Supplements with Good Evidence for Active Women</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Creatine monohydrate:</strong> ~3–5 g/day supports strength, power, cognition, and may be especially helpful in low-estrogen phases.</li>
      <li><strong>Omega-3 (EPA/DHA):</strong> For recovery, mood, and inflammation control if fish intake is low.</li>
      <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> If levels are low or limited sun exposure.</li>
      <li><strong>Iron:</strong> Only if deficient or at risk; test ferritin first and supplement under guidance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Whole foods first. Discuss supplements and bloodwork with your healthcare provider.</em></p>

    <h2>Pelvic Floor, Core, and Injury Prevention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporate pelvic floor awareness (exhale on exertion, maintain rib-pelvis stacking).</li>
      <li>Train anti-rotation (pallof press), bracing (dead bug, plank variations), and hip stability (single-leg work).</li>
      <li>Prioritize sleep (7–9 hours) and deload weeks to lock in adaptations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cycle-Aware Nutrition Toolkit</h2>
    <h3>Premenstrual Comfort</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Magnesium-rich foods (pumpkin seeds, cocoa, leafy greens), omega-3s, and complex carbs.</li>
      <li>Electrolytes and warm fluids to reduce cramps/bloating feelings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>High-Performance Days</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-workout: 20–40 g carbs + 15–25 g protein if training &gt;2–3 hours after last meal.</li>
      <li>Post-workout: 25–40 g protein + 1–1.2 g/kg carbs within ~2 hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Everyday Structure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3–4 protein-anchored meals (25–40 g each) with colorful plants and smart carbs around training.</li>
      <li>Hydration habit: start the day with 300–500 ml water; carry a bottle; salt to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On hormonal contraception:</strong> You may not see classic cycle fluctuations; still anchor training to how you feel and track symptoms.</li>
      <li><strong>Perimenopause:</strong> Double down on heavy resistance training, protein (2.0+ g/kg), creatine, and sprint/HIIT for bone and muscle.</li>
      <li><strong>Vegetarian/Vegan:</strong> Plan protein (soy, dairy if used, eggs, legumes) and iron/B12 carefully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Building Sustainable Habits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Progress over perfection:</strong> Adjust based on your symptoms, sleep, and readiness.</li>
      <li><strong>Measure what matters:</strong> Track cycle day, mood, sleep, training, and hydration in your app.</li>
      <li><strong>Plan the week:</strong> Align harder sessions with follicular/ovulatory windows; schedule deloads late luteal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quick Reference: Phase-by-Phase</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Menstrual:</strong> Mobility + technique; iron-supportive foods; warm up gently.</li>
      <li><strong>Follicular:</strong> Heavy lifts + skill; carb-centered fueling.</li>
      <li><strong>Ovulatory:</strong> Power/HIIT if you feel great; protect joints; protein + carbs after.</li>
      <li><strong>Luteal:</strong> Maintain strength; manage heat; increase electrolytes; prioritize sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>When you train, fuel, and recover in sync with your cycle, you make the physiology work for you. Use these foundations, observe your patterns, and iterate. Over time, you’ll see steadier energy, stronger lifts, better body composition, and a more confident relationship with your health.</p>
    <p><strong>Action step:</strong> This week, track your cycle day, anchor each meal with 25–40 g protein, and add electrolytes to one training session. Build from there—small changes compound.</p>
